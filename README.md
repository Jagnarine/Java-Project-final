# Java-Project-final
1. This is my final project on my game website. In order to run the site locally you will need to download all the files and store in one folder.
2. Edit the files actions in notepad or any code editor and put the file paths where they are located.
3. The images are named after the titles so will not be difficult adding them to the website.
4. In order to the backend form to work you will need to create an account on form.io once that is done copy the link that is presented on your online database and paste the link the registration form action.
5. To use the contact us form you have to visit formsubmit online but you will have to use the raw version of the contact on GitHub directly as you need an online server for this feature to work. copy the link from form submit and replace the sample email with your email address and past the link in the for action for the contact us form to receive the feeback directly. Also you will need to visit htmlpreview.github.io or any other site to preview html code online to view the raw GitHub code online to make this feature work.
